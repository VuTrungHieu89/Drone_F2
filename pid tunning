Step 1: testing the pid 
  set all p_gain = 1 hold the quacopter to fell how the drone stablize itself
  set pitch_p_gain and roll_p_gain to 0 agin
  set yaw_p_gain = 3, yaw_i_gain = 0.02 to prevent yawing when tunning pid for roll and pitch
Step 2: tunning d_gain for pitch and roll
  increase the d_gain up to the point it become restless (vibration)
  lower the d_gain to the point it run smooth again
  continue to lower the d_gain by 25%
Step 3: tunning p_gain for pitch and roll
  increase the p_gain until it become overcompensate
  lower the p_gain by 50%
Step 4: tunning i_gain for pitch and roll
  increase the i_gain to the point the quad_cop oscillate slowly
  lower the i_gain by 50% 
Step 5: tunning p_gain again to get wanted stablization
  increase the p_gain again up to the point of fair oscillation
  lower a few to get a good stable quad-cop
